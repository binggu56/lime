# Welcome to Scitools!

The ojective here is to provide a simple-to-use package for researchers including myself working in diverse fields of quantum mechanics. 

## Current modules 

### noise 
Generate white and colored noise to simulate stohcastic dynamics, e.g., stochastic Schodinger equations. 

### Plotting 
A matplotlib style file to generate publication quality figures. 

### Quantum dynamics 
Methods to solve time-dependent Schodinger equations. 
- Split-operator method with fast fourier transform 

##### Non-adiabatic quantum dynamics 


### Band structure of solids  
- Compute band stucture from tight-binding Hamiltonians. 
- Compute Floquet-Bloch band structure for tight-binding models. 

### Open quantum systems 
- Lindblad quantum master equation 
- Redfield quantum master equation 
- Second-order time-convolutionless master equation 
- Hierachical equation of motion
