# Welcome to Scitools!

The ojective here is to provide a simple-to-use package for researchers including myself working in diverse fields of quantum mechanics. 

## Current modules 

### noise 
Generate white and colored noise to simulate stohcastic dynamics, e.g., stochastic Schodinger equations. 

### Plotting 
A matplotlib style file to generate publication quality figures. 

### Quantum dynamics 
Methods to solve time-dependent Schodinger equations. 

##### Non-adiabatic quantum dynamics 


### Band structure 
Compute band stucture from tight-binding Hamiltonians. 

### Open quantum systems 
__to be added__
