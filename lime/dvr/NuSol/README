=== NuSol Installation ===
NuSol requires a python 2.7 interpreter and the modules Numpy v1.9.1 as well as SciPy v0.14.0.
To install the dependencies type:

(UBUNTU >=12.4)
> sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib ipython;

If your Numpy/Scipy versions are older than this, you can install the required modules into a 
python virtual environment which will provide the required modules for NuSol. In order to build 
the virtual environment please install the following packages:

(UBUNTU >=12.4)
> sudo apt-get install libblas-dev liblapack-dev gfortran python-virtualenv python-pip;

In order to setup the virtual environment execute the install script provided by NuSol
> chmod +x install.sh;
> ./install.sh;

Before running NuSol, activate the virtual environment (only needed if your system does not provide Numpy v1.9.x as well as SciPy v0.14.x): 
> source PATH_TO_NUSOL/nusol/bin/activate;
You can deactivate the virtual environment with
> deactivate;

More information about python virtual environments can be found here: [http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/]

=== Running NuSol ===
Look at the config_example.cfg file for run parameter description, all units are in Hartree atomic units. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_units] 

Execute NuSol via
> python NuSol.py config_example.cfg;

The output file eval.dat will contain the calculated enegies for the 3D harmonic oscillator
E_n = (3/2 + n_x+n_y+n_z) with n = 0,1,2..

=== Running NuSol Examples ===
The ./examples folder contains further example config files.

Run all examples via:
> cd ./examples;
> chmod +x run_all_examples.sh;
> ./run_all_examples.sh;

Run only the 1D and 2D examples (much faster):
> cd ./examples;
> chmod +x run_examples_quick.sh;
> ./run_examples_quick.sh;

Eigenvector (evec.dat) visualization scripts can be found in the ./examples/visualization folder.

=== Using the FEAST interface (OPTIONAL) ===
Solving the Numerov matrix can take a long time depending on the system size. In addition to 
the ARPACK-NG solver, NuSol can also solve the Numerov matrix using the FEAST library. However,
this does not provide additional functionality to NuSol, it only speeds up Numerov calculations.
To use the optional FEAST solver specify the INTEL MKL and FEAST paths
> source /usr/local/intel/MKLVARS intel64;
> source /usr/local/intel/ICCVARS intel64;
> export FEASTROOT=/PATH/TO/FEAST/ROOT/FEAST/2.1;
build the NuSol_FEAST binary using
> cd ./lib/;
> make NuSol_FEAST;
