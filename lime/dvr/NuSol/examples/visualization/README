Each folder contains a config file together with the generated output files, eval.dat and evec.dat. 
The data plotting scripts are the .py python files in each folder. Do not forget to deactivate the 
python virtual environment:
> deactivate;
in case you installed it

EXAMPLE run: 1D dvr result plotting
> cd dvr1D;
> python plot.py;
The procedure is the same for all subfolders.
