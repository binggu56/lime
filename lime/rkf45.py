#********************************************
#
## R8_RKF45 carries out the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method (double precision).
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    This routine is primarily designed to solve non-stiff and mildly stiff
#    differential equations when derivative evaluations are inexpensive.
#    It should generally not be used when the user is demanding
#    high accuracy.
#
#    This function integrates a system of NEQN first-order ordinary differential
#    equations of the form:
#
#      dY(i)/dT = F(T,Y(1),Y(2), ...  ,Y(NEQN))
#
#    where the Y(1:NEQN) are given at T.
#    Typically the subroutine is used to integrate from T to TOUT but it
#    can be used as a one-step integrator to advance the solution a
#    single step in the direction of TOUT.  On return, the parameters in
#    the call list are set for continuing the integration.  The user has
#    only to call again (and perhaps define a new value for TOUT).
#
#    Before the first call, the user must
#
#    * supply the function  F(T,Y) to evaluate the right hand side YP;
#
#    * initialize the parameters:
#      NEQN, Y(1:NEQN), T, TOUT, RELERR, ABSERR, FLAG.
#      In particular, T should initially be the starting point for integration,
#      Y should be the value of the initial conditions, and FLAG should
#      normally be +1.
#
#    Normally, the user only sets the value of FLAG before the first call, and
#    thereafter, the program manages the value.  On the first call, FLAG should
#    normally be +1 (or -1 for single step mode.)  On normal return, FLAG will
#    have been reset by the program to the value of 2 (or -2 in single
#    step mode), and the user can continue to call the routine with that
#    value of FLAG.
#
#    (When the input magnitude of FLAG is 1, this indicates to the program
#    that it is necessary to do some initialization work.  An input magnitude
#    of 2 lets the program know that that initialization can be skipped,
#    and that useful information was computed earlier.)
#
#    The function returns with all the information needed to continue
#    the integration.  If the integration reached TOUT, the user need only
#    define a new TOUT and call again.  In the one-step integrator
#    mode, returning with FLAG = -2, the user must keep in mind that
#    each step taken is in the direction of the current TOUT.  Upon
#    reaching TOUT, indicated by the output value of FLAG switching to 2,
#    the user must define a new TOUT and reset FLAG to -2 to continue
#    in the one-step integrator mode.
#
#    In some cases, an error or difficulty occurs during a call.  In that case,
#    the output value of FLAG is used to indicate that there is a problem
#    that the user must address.  These values include:
#
#    * 3, integration was not completed because the input value of RELERR, the
#      relative error tolerance, was too small.  RELERR has been increased
#      appropriately for continuing.  If the user accepts the output value of
#      RELERR, then simply reset FLAG to 2 and continue.
#
#    * 4, integration was not completed because more than MAXNFE derivative
#      evaluations were needed.  This is approximately (MAXNFE/6) steps.
#      The user may continue by simply calling again.  The function counter
#      will be reset to 0, and another MAXNFE function evaluations are allowed.
#
#    * 5, integration was not completed because the solution vanished,
#      making a pure relative error test impossible.  The user must use
#      a non-zero ABSERR to continue.  Using the one-step integration mode
#      for one step is a good way to proceed.
#
#    * 6, integration was not completed because the requested accuracy
#      could not be achieved, even using the smallest allowable stepsize.
#      The user must increase the error tolerances ABSERR or RELERR before
#      continuing.  It is also necessary to reset FLAG to 2 (or -2 when
#      the one-step integration mode is being used).  The occurrence of
#      FLAG = 6 indicates a trouble spot.  The solution is changing
#      rapidly, or a singularity may be present.  It often is inadvisable
#      to continue.
#
#    * 7, it is likely that this routine is inefficient for solving
#      this problem.  Too much output is restricting the natural stepsize
#      choice.  The user should use the one-step integration mode with
#      the stepsize determined by the code.  If the user insists upon
#      continuing the integration, reset FLAG to 2 before calling
#      again.  Otherwise, execution will be terminated.
#
#    * 8, invalid input parameters, indicates one of the following:
#      NEQN <= 0;
#      T = TOUT and |FLAG| /= 1;
#      RELERR < 0 or ABSERR < 0;
#      FLAG == 0  or FLAG < -2 or 8 < FLAG.

#
#  Parameters:
#
#    Input, function F, a user-supplied function to evaluate the
#    derivatives dYdT(T), of the form:
#     def f ( t, y ):
#         <statements>
#         return(yp)
#
#    Input, integer NEQN, the number of equations to be integrated.
#
#    Input/output, real Y(NEQN), the current solution vector at T.
#
#    Input/output, real YP(NEQN), the current value of the
#    derivative of the dependent variable.  The user should not set or alter
#    this information%
#
#    Input/output, real T, the current value of the independent
#    variable.
#
#    Input, real TOUT, the output point at which solution is
#    desired.  TOUT = T is allowed on the first call only, in which case
#    the routine returns with FLAG = 2 if continuation is possible.
#
#    Input, real RELERR, ABSERR, the relative and absolute
#    error tolerances for the local error test.  At each step the code
#    requires:
#      abs ( local error ) <= RELERR * abs ( Y ) + ABSERR
#    for each component of the local error and the solution vector Y.
#    RELERR cannot be "too small".  If the routine believes RELERR has been
#    set too small, it will reset RELERR to an acceptable value and return
#    immediately for user action.
#
#    Input/output, integer FLAG, indicator for status of integration.
#    On the first call, set FLAG to +1 for normal use, or to -1 for single
#    step mode.  On return, a value of 2 or -2 indicates normal progress,
#    while any other value indicates a problem that should be addressed.

#
#    This routine integrates a system of NEQN first order ordinary differential
#    equations of the form
#      dY(i)/dT = F(T,Y(1:NEQN))
#    where the initial values Y and the initial derivatives
#    YP are specified at the starting point T.
#
#    The routine advances the solution over the fixed step H and returns
#    the fifth order (sixth order accurate locally) solution
#    approximation at T+H in array S.
#
#    The formulas have been grouped to control loss of significance.
#    The routine should be called with an H not smaller than 13 units of
#    roundoff in T so that the various independent arguments can be
#    distinguished.
