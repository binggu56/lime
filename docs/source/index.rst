Welcome to lime's documentation!
================================

The goal is to provide a simple-to-use package to study how light interacts with matter.  

Check docs/manual.pdf for documentations.

Main modules


Nonlinear molecular spectroscopy 
--------------------------------

#. sum-of-states for multilevel system

Pros: computationally cheap 

.. note:: decay is introduced phenomelogically; pure dephasing cannot be addressed.  

#. correlation function approach --  Direct computing the many-point correlation functions with the quantum regression theorem 


Valid for open quantum systems where environment effects can be rigirously described with open quantum system techniques. 

Visulize with double-sided Feynman diagrams instead of the time-loop diagrams. 


#. non-perturbative approah -- valid for ALL systems provided the quantum dynamics can be compuated 

Simulating the laser-driven dynamics including explicitly all laser pulses    

Molecular quantum dynamics 
--------------------------

- Adiabatic wavepacket dynamics 
	* Split-operator method 
	* Discrete variable representation 

- Nonadiabatic wavepacket dynamics 
	* Split-operator method - For the exact nonadiabatic dynamics of vibronic models in the diabatic representation. 
	* RK4 -  For the exact nonadiabatic wavepacket dynamics in the adiabatic representation.
