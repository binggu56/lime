Nonlinear molecular spectroscopy 
--------------------------------

#. Sum-of-states (SOS) for multilevel system

	Pros: computationally cheap and intuitive

	.. note:: In the SOS method, decay is introduced phenomelogically. 

#. correlation function approach --  Direct computing the many-point correlation functions with the quantum regression theorem 


	Valid for open quantum systems where environment effects can be rigirously described with quantum master equations. 

	Visulize with double-sided Feynman diagrams instead of the time-loop diagrams. 


#. non-perturbative approah -- valid for ALL systems provided a quantum dynamics solver is provided.  

	Simulating the laser-driven dynamics including explicitly all laser pulses
